- 👋 Hi, I’m @speck888
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning coding basics and more about Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... will update this when I decide what to start on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... learning experience, what worked for you or where would be a good place to start the self learning process.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Is messaging a feature on github? That would probably be the best, not sure if I should give out my email in this section.
